Exercise for new React 16.3 Features

This React project includes some soon to be deprecated lifecycle methods that
need to be updated to use the new lifecycle methods.

After reviewing this article: https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/27/update-on-async-rendering.html

* Clone this project
* run 'npm start' to run in browser.
* Project currently consists of a click counter, a scrolling list, and a button

  * When the button is clicked, the counter is incremented and a new name is added to the scrolling list (scroll posisition is maintained)

* The exercise is to update myComponent.js to use the new lifecycle methods covered in the article.

- This exercise will be updated and expanded in the future to demonstrate other new features (i.e. context api)
